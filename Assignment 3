Analysis of Boarding Schools:
The Indian boarding school system was not an educational initiative but a strategic form of state-sanctioned violence designed for cultural erasure. These institutions functioned as "crime scenes" where children were taken from their tribes and forced to abandon their native tongues under threat of punishment. The search for unmarked graves proves that this violence is a living legacy that society must acknowledge for healing and accountability.

Analysis of Dr. Uhuru’s Lecture:
Dr. Uhuru’s lecture at the Columbus monument highlights the "dialectics" of colonial space. The statue in Santo Domingo represents a problematic power dynamic, showing an Indigenous person at the feet of Columbus. This indoctrination in public spaces socializes the public to celebrate the colonizer while ignoring the ethnocide and suffering experienced by Indigenous people.
